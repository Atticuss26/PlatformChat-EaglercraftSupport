# PlatformChat

PlatformChat is a simple Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin that provides enhanced chat formatting with support for Bedrock players (via Floodgate) and PlaceholderAPI integration. It allows configurable chat prefixes and color-coded messages for both Java and Bedrock editions.

---

## Features

- Different chat formats for Java and Bedrock players
- PlaceholderAPI support for dynamic placeholders
- Configurable prefixes and color codes via `config.yml`
- Supports Floodgate API to detect Bedrock players
- Uses color codes with `&` symbols translated into Minecraft colors

---

## Requirements

- Java 17+ (matches your server's Java version)
- Bukkit/Spigot/Paper Minecraft server (1.16+ recommended)
- [Floodgate plugin](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate) (for Bedrock player detection)
- [PlaceholderAPI plugin](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI) (optional, for placeholder support)
- [FloodgatePlaceholders](https://github.com/rtm516/FloodgatePlaceholders) (recommended to get Floodgate placeholders working)

## Installation

1. Download or build the `PlatformChat.jar`.
2. Place the JAR file into your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Start the server once to generate the default config file.
4. Modify `plugins/PlatformChat/config.yml` to your liking (see Configuration section).
5. Restart or reload your server.

java-format: '&7[Java] &a%player_name%&f: %message%'
````

* `use-placeholderapi`: Enable or disable PlaceholderAPI support.
* `prefix`: A string prefix prepended to all messages.
* `bedrock-format`: Chat format for Bedrock players. Use `%player_name%`, `%message%`, and Floodgate placeholders like `%floodgate_device%`.
